# School-Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition

## Overview
The **School Attendance System using Face Recognition** is designed to automate the process of attendance management in educational institutions. By leveraging the power of face recognition, this system ensures accurate and efficient tracking of student attendance. It also includes real-time communication with parents, providing updates about their child's attendance. This project embodies a modern, innovative approach to attendance tracking, aligning with the digital transformation in education.

## Features
- **Automated Attendance Tracking**: Uses face recognition technology to identify students and mark their attendance automatically.
- **Real-time Updates**: Sends attendance updates to parents via email.
- **Secure and Reliable**: Ensures that attendance data is securely stored and easily retrievable.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive GUI built using Tkinter and TTK.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed attendance reports, including weekly and monthly summaries and attendance percentages.

## How It Works
1. **Student Enrollment**: Students are enrolled in the system by capturing their images and storing them in a database, along with their personal details.
2. **Attendance Marking**: When a student appears in front of the camera, the system recognizes their face and automatically marks their attendance in the database.
3. **Real-time Notifications**: An email is sent to the parents notifying them of their child's attendance status.
4. **Reporting**: The system generates detailed attendance reports, including individual student reports with attendance summaries over different periods (weekly, monthly).
